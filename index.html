						<h3 class="unitPart">Unit 2.2</h3>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">1. In your own words, describe what event driven programming is. What event handler was used in the I Have a Dream app? How was it used?</h3>
							<p class="answer">Event driven programming is a form of coding in which the program responds to an action that has occured within the program. In the I Have a Dream app, the even handler was the clicking of the images of MLK and Malcom X. Clicking the images was used for playing of speeches from MLK and Malcom X and pausing them when pressed again.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">2. Is it possible to create an app without event driven programming? Explain.</h3>
							<p class="answer">It is not possible to create an app without event driven programming because unless the app is all visual and is only meant for the user to see automatically, there will be a need for event driven programming to allow the program to respond to the actions of the user.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">3. What elements and compoments make up the User Interface (UI) for the I Have a Dream app?</h3>
							<p class="answer">The I Have a Dream app uses if and else statements for clicking the images on the screen, and a audio player for playing the speeches when the image is clicked.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">4. What are some of the elements that make up the UI for a car? A vending machine?</h3>
							<p class="answer">Elements for UI in a car is the ability to play music from connecting to phones, displaying a GPS for users to see where they are going, and a touch screen to make it easier for the user to get through the options. For a vending machine, the UI shows the drinks that are available and an option for different flavors of the option. Once the images have been clicked, the maching pours the selected drink through the funnel to where the cup is.</p>

						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">1. In your own words, give a sentence that would explain to a friend the difference between the WWW and the internet.</h3>
							<p class="answer">The difference between the WWW and the internet is how the WWW is a part of the internet and reperesents information that is held withing the internet that can be accesed by most people. On the other hand the interent is larger than the WWW and make up everything that is online related and is basically the infrastructure for the WWW.</p>

						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">2. List a beneficial effect and a harmful effect for a social media app that you discussed in your POGIL group. Are the effects on society, culture, or economics? Include a screenshot of the Venn diagram you made with your group.</h3>
							<p class="answer">Some benefits that come from social media apps are their ability to connect people who otherwise would have forgotten each other. Friendships could be kept and people are able to share their lives on a platform for others to see. While the benefits are nice, some downsides to social media apps are their addicting and time consuming traits. Once someone gets on social media, they will be hooked onto it for some time. Another downside is the presence of cyber bullying online which effect some people's lives.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">3. If you were a developer of one of the social media apps that you discussed, how would you reduce the harmful effects?</h3>
							<p class="answer">To reduce the harmful effects of social media apps as a developer, I would create a alert wihin the app that tells the user how long they have been using the app and that it is recommended to take a break and do something else.</p>

						<h3 class="unitPart">Unit 2.4</h3>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">1. What components make up the User Interface (UI) for this enhanced version of the I Have A Dream app?</h3>
							<p class="answer">The components that make up the user interface for the I have a dream app are the buttons which allow the user to navigate through the app. Another component for the UI is the accelerometer which allows the user to shake the phone and play an audio file in the process.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">2. A computational artifact is something created by a human using a computer.  We've just created a mobile app, which is certainly an example of such a artifact.  Given examples from your own experience of computational artifacts that you've created -- images, videos, presentations, mash-ups -- and describe the software you used to create them. </h3>
							<p class="answer">Some computation artifacts that I have made are music videos for a final project in class. To make the video, I used Adobe Premiere to help me edit and piece together recorded clips for the video.</p>

						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">1.Give an example of a special purpose computer that you are familiar with and briefly describe its hardware and its software.</h3>
							<p class="answer">A special purpose computer that I know is a calculator. The hardware within it is small but contains a processing unit to do calculations and solar panels to provide power for the calculator. The software within the calculator helps take in the imput from the buttons and tells the processor to calculate and display the results.</p>

						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">3. As we learned in this lesson, a byte is about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter 't'. There are approximately 7 million characters in all of the Harry Potter novels combined. How many bytes of memory would all of the Harry Potter novels take up? How many copies of the Harry Potter novels would fit on a 7 Gigabyte flash drive. (Remember 1 Gigabyte is 1 billion bytes.)</h3>
							<p class="answer">There would be about 7 million bytes for all the Harry Potter novels and about 142 copies of the Harry Potter books would fit into a 1 GB flash drive.</p>

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">3. (POGIL) Include a description or a photo of your drawing of a maze that the general algorithm in the POGIL exercise CANNOT solve.</h3>
							<p class="answer">A maze that the algorithm cannot solve would have two given directions for the conditional to check but would go to one of the directions over the other. The one that the conditional would choose first would be the dead end and thus prevent the algorithm from solving the maze.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">

								REPEAT 10 times <br>
								{
									<br>
								----IF (item == cups) <br>

						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">2.Describe how you designed your app's UI. What components does it use?</h3>
							<p class="answer">We designed out app's UI by giving different sections of the app in different screens for different file types to play. We would have a button to switch between screens and then those screens would have buttons with images for the user to click on and play an audio file.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">3.Now that you've had some experience building apps in App Inventor, what do you think about programming. Is it a creative activity? In what ways does it allow you to express yourself?
							</h3>
							<p class="answer">After programming an app, I think that programming is a very creative activity for the programmer to use because of the endless possibilities for the creator to set up the UI. Programming allows me to express myself by giving me control of what I want to put on the app and where are located.</p>

						<div class="questionAnswerContainer">
							<h3 class="question">2 Give 2-3 examples of abstractions in everyday life not identified in the lecture.</h3>
							<p class="answer">Abstractions that are in everyday life are traffic lights, and street signs. In traffics lights, the lights for the stop and go are limited to two colors.
