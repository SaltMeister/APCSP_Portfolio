                            <h3 class="question">1. This app presents a new type of event which you haven't encountered before. What is that new event? How often is it triggered?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The new event is the clock event handler which triggered whenever the timer interval is met.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">2. Consider the apps you've developed so far. Can you list all the different events your apps have responded to? What other events do you think an app can respond to? Explore some of the components in App Inventor and see what event handlers they have.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The apps that we have created has responded to events such as phone shakes, and phone movement. Some other events that the mit app inventor allows are after recording, or when a recording starts.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">3. What are the advantages of writing procedures in programming? Use the procedures you wrote for this app as examples in your response.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The advantages of writing procedures in programming are to simplify the main code into smaller chunks of code that can be easily called in the future. In our example, the procedure helps manage the random placement of the target whenever the timer for the clock goes off.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">1. Describe the purpose of each enhancement that you added to your app. Give brief descriptions of the enhancements and provide screenshots of important blocks and describe how you used them to solve certain programming problems. Include these descriptions in your write-up, below.</h3>

                            <p class="answer">An some enhancements that we made in our project were the increasing difficulty, moving the target a random position, and increasing the score whenever the user hits the target. To increase the difficulty, we set a variable to be the score which the difficulty increases. We used a procedure to make
                                the target smaller and the interval for moving the target to a random point shorter, then we increased the variable to a value higher than the score and will increase the difficulty later. We implimented the random target position by creating a procedure to move the sprite to a random number on the x and y axis of
                                the canvas. We inplimented the score by creating a variable that would incremented by 1 everytime the user clicks the target. To solve some problems that would come up such as clicking multiple times on the target for the same score, and the difficulty getting impossibly hard, we implimented a few fixes. For the score,
                                we had a boolean change to true or false depending on if the user clicked the target, if so it would increase the score and be set back to false. For the impossible difficulty, we created a conditional to limit the timer length and the size of the target after a certain value.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">2. When the user touches an ImageSprite, both the Canvas.Touched and ImageSprite.Touched events are triggered. This is important for more complex games. For instance, suppose there are "good" and "bad" sprites in your game. If you hit one, you earn a point. If you hit the other, you lose two points. If you hit the Canvas and don't hit the ImageSprite, you lose 1 point. How would you code this?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">To code hitting both the canvas and the image sprite, I would get their event handlers for if a user clicked on the screen and then lower the life variable if the user touched the canvas, and increasing the user's score if they touch the image sprite.</p>

You can take a screenshot on most Android devices by pressing the power button and the volume down button and the same time and then emailing the photo from the gallery to yourself, or uploading the image to Google Drive.
                            To practice for the Create task, describe how two of the algorithms (procedures that you wrote) in the code combine to form a bigger algorithm (the drawFace procedure).</h3>

                            <p class="answer">The procedures that I wrote within the code, drawMouth and drawHead, combine to form the drawFace procedure as they allow the pen to draw the mouth and the head of the face. Those procedures allow the pen to draw on the canvas, allowing the drawFace procedure to finish its drawing.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">2. Can you draw a triangle with this set of Logo commands? Discuss how or why not.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">You cannot draw a triangle with the set of Logo commands because the turns for the pen aren't at an angle that would allow you to create a triangle. There are only 90 degree angle turns and no 45 degree angle turns that would create a triangle.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="question">3. Discuss: If you were designing the Logo language, how would you change some of our basic commands so that it would be easy to draw a triangle and easier to draw other shapes -- i.e., what should the basic commands do that would make drawing easier.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">If I were to design the Logo language, I would allow the function adjust the angle that the pen turns to allow for me to create a triangle easily. A basic command would be to allow a turn 45 degree angle which would allow for a equilateral triangle that can be created easily.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">4. What weaknesses do you find in using the procedures (the abstractions) we gave you -- forward, turn -- for drawing simple shapes? How would you change the definitions of these procedures to make it easier to draw shapes? Give a specific example that illustrates how a more powerful set of procedures would improve things.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">A weakness I found in using the procedure is that lack of size that we sould use. The procedure also doesn't give and hints that would make the process easier. If I were to change the procedure, I would give some more specifice instructions, such as create a head with a 2 lines on each side, this would allow the user to have a specific size to use for the image they are going to make.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">1. (POGIL) According to your results, does App Inventor's PRNG provide a good model of randomness?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">According to the results, App inventor does a decent job at randomizing the heads and tails as the head count total after the 20 tests of 100 flips were nearly equal to each other.</p>

                            <p class="answer">A response that we would reply with is that you’re not doing it enough to get a more equal result. The coin flip is not always 50/50.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">3. Because we are using a coin flip app, this experiment really tests only that App Inventor's random integer block generates a 1 around half the time. Is this a sufficient test for App Inventor's PRNG? What other experiments might you do to increase your confidence in App Inventor’s PRNG?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">This is a sufficient test that app inventor has a good prng because it tests the results of a random number over a period of trials. To make sure that we are confident of the result, we should have a lot more tests to see if the results are still almost equalt to 50/50.</p>

                            <p class="answer">No, the wolves would not live forever because everything would die. The rabbits would die off first because they are being hunted by the wolves, and since there’s only a limited amount of rabbits, there would be nothing left for the wolves to hunt eventually, and they die off.</p>

Why do you think the creators focused on these data elements and not others? How might this introduce bias (concentration on or interest in a particular area) into the simulation?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The person wanted to test the relationship between the wolves and the bunnies and grass. Any other factors could shift the population of both rabbits and bunnies leading to a skewed result of population sizes. Adding more factors into the simulation would introduce bias as the added factors would change a certain variable in the relationship between bunnies and wolves.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">3. Earlier in the course, you built the Map Tour app. In the final version, what kind of data is collected from the user? Does the user know the data is being collected? Can they opt out of providing data and still use the app?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The data that is collected of the user in the Map Tour app is their location. The user should know that their data is being collected, as map apps need the location of the user to display their location in a variable. Users can opt out of the app taking their location, but they will not have access to their current location data.</p>

                            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/technology/facebook-ftc-fine-privacy.html">Link to article</a>

This is an beneficial impact on privacy as Facebook would now need to do  a better job at protecting user data to prevent more fines from the F.T.C.</p>
