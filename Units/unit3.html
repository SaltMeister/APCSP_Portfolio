							<h3 class="question">1. Explain the meaning of the statements shown here, both in AP CSP pseudocode and App Inventor. For example, suppose the variable X has the value 10 before the statement is executed. What value would it have after the statement is executed?</h3>
							<p class="answer">The image represents setting the variable x to itself plus one. If the global variable x was already 10 before the code is executed, after execution, it becomes 10 plus 1 which is 11.</p>

							<h3 class="question">2. One aspect of abstraction is that it helps to reduce details to focus on what's relevant. How does the use of a variable, such as dotsize, instead of a value, such as '5', help to reduce detail and focus on what is essential in this program?</h3>
							<p class="answer">Attributing a piece of data to a variable helps make the code more abstract as the complex line of code that has a piece of data is now stored inside of a single word variable that can be called on at anytime to be used or changed. This reduces the need to remember the line of code that stores the data and to use a word instead.</p>

							<h3 class="question">2. Describe what it means to say that JPEG is a lossy compression technique and whether or not it affects the quality of camera pictures.</h3>
							<p class="answer">When a JPEG has gone through lossy compression, the pixels that are repetitive and not needed are removed completely from the file, shortening it. The technique does lower the quality camera pictures but not enough for humans to visibly notice.</p>
