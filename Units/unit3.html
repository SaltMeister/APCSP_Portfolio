                            <h3 class="question">1. Explain the meaning of the statements shown here, both in AP CSP pseudocode and App Inventor. For example, suppose the variable X has the value 10 before the statement is executed. What value would it have after the statement is executed?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The image represents setting the variable x to itself plus one. If the global variable x was already 10 before the code is executed, after execution, it becomes 10 plus 1 which is 11.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">2. One aspect of abstraction is that it helps to reduce details to focus on what's relevant. How does the use of a variable, such as dotsize, instead of a value, such as '5', help to reduce detail and focus on what is essential in this program?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">Attributing a piece of data to a variable helps make the code more abstract as the complex line of code that has a piece of data is now stored inside of a single word variable that can be called on at anytime to be used or changed. This reduces the need to remember the line of code that stores the data and to use a word instead.</p>

                            <p class="answer">When a JPEG has gone through lossy compression, the pixels that are repetitive and not needed are removed completely from the file, shortening it. The technique does lower the quality camera pictures but not enough for humans to visibly notice.</p>

PROVIDE A SCREENSHOT OF YOUR APP'S CODE -- the revised blocks -- and describe how the if/else block works to solve the problem in this case. If appropriate, include a description of any significant problems or bugs you encountered in solving this problem. App Inventor now has a Download Blocks as Image feature (right click on the white space in the blocks editor to choose) that also can be used to take a screenshot of all of your code or the Windows snipping tool can be used.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">For enhancement #5 I used a function/procedure to do the job that the buttons had to do. The prodecure contained all of the color change code depending on what button was clicked, so if the function was called and it takes in the button value, it takes in the name of the button pressed and compares it with an if else statement, then the conditional will change the color of the pen. The buttons on the otherhand called the function/procedure and gave it its name as a value for the function/procedure to use.</p>

HINT: Think about the different hardware components we talked about in an earlier lesson and where on the device the picture is stored. What do you think could be done to prevent the picture from disappearing when the app is restarted?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The camera picture goes away when the app is restarted because of how the image taken is not stored anywhere and just replaces the background image of the canvas. To keep the image after a restart, you must store the image into the database and set the canvas to load the image from the database when </p>

                            <h3 class="question">1. (POGIL) Describe an algorithm for identifying the card that was flipped.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">The algorithm for identifying the flipped cards was to add a row of cards on the outside of the set of cards to even out the face up cards in the rows and columns, then if there was an odd set of face up cards, it would be the flipped one.</p>

                            <h3 class="question">2. (POGIL) The card "trick" shows that it is always possible to identify the card that was flipped as long as only one card was flipped. Would it be possible always to determine if an error occurred if two cards were flipped?</h3>
                            <p class="answer">Flipping two cards would work only if the two cards do not interfere with each other. Since flipping two cards in the same row or column would cause the amount of flipped cards to be even, it would be very hard to determine what card was flipped.
                            The column or row from the 2 card flips would also lead to one of the 2 having an error while another having hidden errors.</p>

                            <p class="answer">The error card trick detected the errors by using parity bits to detect any odd values in the row and columns.</p>

                            <p class="answer">Limitations for using parity bits for error detections are that if an even amount of cards where changed in the rows and cloumns, the user or computer would not be able to detect the error.</p>

                            <p class="answer">The check sum is a error detecton system that has the sum of different bits within the file and if changes were made, then it gets checksums from the file later to check if the values are different or not.</p>

                            and some of the functions you can control with it. Describe your results below.</h3>
                            <p class="answer">APIs help simplify complex programming tasks by allowing the program to communicate with a server instead of working on their own to complete the job.
                            Apps like Google Maps would be enormous in size if it wasn't for APIs. The API allows Google Maps to communicate and send information that the user needs when the time comes.</p>

                            <p class="answer">The GPS is used in the Map App by allowing the map to locate the user's devices location. GPS works by letting the phone communicate with navigation satellites that surround the Earth.

                                  the lat and longitute of the location is added onto a coordinate list while the name is saved on a name list.
